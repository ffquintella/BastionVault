//! Resource Connect session module.
//!
//! Per-session state lives on `AppState::connect_sessions`, keyed by
//! a one-shot token handed to the spawned WebviewWindow. The
//! window's React route ([`SessionSshWindow.tsx`]) claims its
//! session via that token and drives the PTY through the Tauri
//! `session_input` / `session_resize` / `session_close` commands.
//!
//! Phase 3 implements the SSH side (`secret` credential source).
//! RDP (`ironrdp` + `<canvas>`) is Phase 4; LDAP / SSH-engine / PKI
//! credential sources land in Phases 5–6.
